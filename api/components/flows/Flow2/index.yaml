summary: Flow2 - Seller raising a complaint for policy issue
details:
  - description:  This flow provides an illustrative example workflow for the IGM framework where a seller / seller app (complainant) raises a complaint that their store is not visible on the respective buyer app tagging the transaction id of the /on_search request shared along with the provider_id of the seller. The buyer analyses the complaints and proposes a resolution saying the seller would now be visible. The seller accepts the resolution and the buyer app resolves the same claiming it is now visible on the interface. The seller escalates the complaint as the seller is still not visible. The GRO of the buyer app gets involved and attempts to analyse the complaint. They propose a resolution acknowledging the mistake in their catalogue processing workflow and resolve the complaint. The seller is now visible on the buyer app interface and the seller closes the complaint.
